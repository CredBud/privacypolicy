# CREDBUD PRIVACY POLICIES

## Introduction
CredBud is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information ('personal data'). In the Privacy Policy, we explain how we collect, use, share, retain and transfer information. We also let you know your rights. Each section of the Policy includes helpful examples and simpler language to make our practices easier to understand. We've also added links to resources where you can learn more about the privacy topics that interest you.

This privacy policy describes how we collect and use your personal data during the admissions process in accordance with Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023. It should be read in conjunction with the privacy policy of the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS).

This policy applies to prospective undergraduate students. In addition, each college1 will have its own privacy notice. It is important that you read this policy, together with any other privacy policy we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing information about you, so that you are aware of how and why we are using the information. We may update this policy at any time. It's important to us that you know how to control your privacy, so we also show you where you can manage your information in the settings of the CredBud you use.
